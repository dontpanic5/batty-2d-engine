roots spread out instead of straight following
seeds that grow roots
rocks that block the root
You should have dry dirt and wet dirt which lets you see that the roots will go to wet dirt first. If you have enough turns, you can go past the root before it gets you. If not, you will go the dry dirt way since the roots will look for wet dirt first. Could even have wet dirt or really wet dirt split roots to be more of a blockage. Could also give the player the ability to place water and lead roots.
